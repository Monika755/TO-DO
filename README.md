# 📝 To-Do List App Documentation

## 📖 Overview
This is a simple **To-Do List** web application built with **React**.  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete**, and **mark tasks as completed**.  
All tasks are managed using **React state** (and optionally saved to **localStorage**).

---

## ⚙️ Features
- ➕ **Add new tasks** — create new to-do items  
- ✏️ **Edit tasks** — modify an existing task’s text  
- ✅ **Mark tasks as completed** — mark tasks as done or undone  
- ❌ **Delete tasks** — remove tasks from the list  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user types a task in the input field and clicks **Add**.  
2. The task is stored in a **state array** using `useState`.  
3. When a task is marked as done, the component updates its **status**.  
4. The **Delete** button removes the task from the list.  
5. Tasks are optionally saved in **localStorage** so they persist after reload.
